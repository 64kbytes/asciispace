## INTENT
Hard Sci-fi is one of my favourite genres for would-be-video-games. I think I'll always have a space game waiting to be written. So I intend to iteratively write MY DREAM SPACE GAME :)
Odds are 10/1 that project will froze and remain at vapourware state at some moment. Maybe forever, but what the heck!

## OVERVIEW
A hardcore slow paced almost-no-combat space RPG focused on detailed spacecraft and economy models
